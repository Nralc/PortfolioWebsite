        Hi! I’m a Computer Science graduate from Lyceum of the Philippines University – Batangas, majoring in Data Science. I’m passionate about building software and uncovering insights from data, blending both to create meaningful tech.<br/><br/>
        I’ve developed full-stack apps, including a productivity tool with Firebase and Java, and an admin dashboard for content moderation. During internships, I gained hands-on experience with web technologies like HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL, while sharpening my debugging and collaboration skills.<br/><br/>
        With a strong foundation in machine learning, visualization, and statistical analysis, I’ve been honing my skills in Python, SQL, and JavaScript. <br/><br/> I'm now seeking full-time opportunities where I can grow as a developer and data practitioner, contribute to impactful projects, and work with teams that value innovation.
